A very good script for automatic farm tickets in the Roblox game "Evade". The script was made based on a simple script from Bac0nH1ck (https://github.com/SpiderScriptRB/By-Bac0nH1ckOff)

Functionality:

— Ticket farming using the platform as in Unknown hub X (This farm method can be turned off and on) 

— A counter for the number and face value of tickets collected using this script. (If the farm is turned off, the meter will not work) 

— 4 languages in the script. English, Russian, Spanish and Chinese. They can also be changed (Lol, I do not know why I did this) 

The script does not have a key and it will always be absolutely free. 

The script only needs to be run in a round! It will not be able to start in the Evade main menu.
